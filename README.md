## Known Bugs/To Do

1. Upon saving an edit, the textbox doesn't immediately show your new edits. You have to click on the note from the list again.
2. Updates occasionally return a MySQL error and don't take hold. Seems to happen when the textbox has multiple lines but I can't always replicate the issue. Sometimes it just works?
3. Considering changing the size of the wrapping div to make it full screen on desktop.
4. The notes just keep going if you have a lot of them. Maybe add pagination.
